ABSTRACT
    PDL::GA - Genetic algorithm utilities for PDL

REQUIREMENTS
    *   PDL

        Tested version(s) 2.4.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.7_001, 2.4.9_015.

DESCRIPTION
    PDL::GA provides some basic utilities for running genetic algorithms on
    PDLs.

BUILDING
    Build this module as you would any perl module, by doing something akin
    to the following:

     gzip -dc distname-XX.YY.tar.gz | tar -xof -
     cd distname-XX.YY/
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test                                     # optional
     make install

    See perlmodinstall(1) for details.
